    <div class="title">PRINCE ADEBANJO ADEJUWON EMPOWERS IJARE MARKET WOMEN WITH ZERO INTEREST LOAN</div>
    
    <p>An Ijare born philanthropist, Prince Adejuwon Adebanjo on Tuesday 9th of April, 2024 in Ijare Youth Center distributed an interest-free loan of ten million to market women in Ijare community.</p>

<p>According to him, this gesture was borne out of the support Ijare women gave to his late father during the 1983 saga when some political thugs were planning to attack his father house, including that of his grandfather and other properties. His father was Prince Adebanjo who was the then Chairman of Ifedore Local Government. The day was saved by the resistance of women whom his father had touched their lives, otherwise it could have been a different story today. He showed appreciation to the women that if not for their courage, maybe the story of his life would have been unfavourable today
</p>
<p>Prince Adejuwon prayed for these women and their children that their response impressed him and promise to involve more of Ijare sons and daughters who are doing well all over the world in the project. He also praised the Executive Director of the project, Mr Samuel Idowu and Mrs Omowumi Lawrence, the coordinator for the job well done 
</p>
<p>
    In her words, the project coordinator, Mrs Omowumi Lawrence explained how the market women have been divided into groups to make the distribution easier. The only requirement according to her is for the beneficiaries to go and open an account with microfinance Bank with their names and register with them thereafter. No form is obtained as all the process is free of charge. No interest, administrative charges, no collateral or advance payment whatsoever. It takes each beneficiary six months to repay the loans
</p>

Some of the beneficiaries who spoke at the event expressed their gratitude towards Prince Adejuwon and shower prayers on him
</p>

<p>
    After the exercise, the Executive Director, Mr Samuel Idowu gave the votes of thanks by showing unconditional appreciation to the Chairman, Prince Adejuwon for the good gesture of giving back to the Community that have done so well for him
