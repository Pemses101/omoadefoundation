 <p>
    Dear Ijare National Students Union Executive Body, Team Exploits, and distinguished guests,
 </p>

<p>
    I am deeply humbled and honored to receive this prestigious Honorary Award from the Ijare National Students Union. I am truly grateful for this recognition, and I accept it with great pride.
</p>

<p>
    I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Ijare National Students Union for this esteemed award. Your acknowledgment of my contributions to the development of Ijare and its youth is a testament to the power of community and the impact that we can have when we work together towards a common goal.
</p>

<p>
    As the founder of the Omo'ba Adebanjo Foundation, I have always been committed to empowering the youth and promoting education, healthcare, and economic development in our community. This award serves as a reminder that our efforts are making a difference, and it motivates me to continue working tirelessly towards creating a brighter future for our people.
</p>

<p>
    In 2021, I initiated an education project to honor my late father's tenth year remembrance. We sponsored ten students, five primary and five secondary school students, and increased the number to 14 in the following year. This project is close to my heart, and I am committed to continuing this legacy.
</p>

<p>
    In fact, I am pleased to announce that I have decided to give the students union five slots in the upcoming postgraduate full scholarship in this coming year. This is our way of investing in the future of Ijare's brightest minds.
</p>

<p>
    Furthermore, as stated in my father's will, I will release the share given to Ijare Students Union in the first quarter of the coming year. This represents ten percent of one of his estates, and I believe it will go a long way in supporting the union's initiatives.
</p>

<p>
    I would like to dedicate this award to my family, friends, and colleagues who have supported me throughout my journey. Your love, encouragement, and hard work have been instrumental in my success, and I am forever grateful.
</p>
<p>
    God bless you all, and God bless our beloved community.
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,
</p>

<p>
    Prince Adebanjo Adejuwon
